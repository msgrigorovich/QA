# QA
This repository is a list of my achievements in writing test documentation (test artifacts).

During the last year of my experience in QA, I decided that I wanted to devote a lot of time to writing test documentation. This is what I do well and this is what I like to do.
I posted my check-list and test-cases on the links to Google Sheets. Access is limited, of course.

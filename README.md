    QA Management
</h1>

Hi, everyone! One of my greatest passions is management and project documentation.When I first started working at QA, I always had to either make up documentation on the fly, or always keep it in my head. This, of course, develops the employeeâ€™s memory and adaptability, but in difficult and stressful situations it only played a negative role.
Over time, I wrote a bunch of different documentation like the following:
* Check-Lists;
* Test-Cases; 
* Test-Plans; 
* Test classification; 
* Requirements specification and etc.

But I was still worried that all that documentation was in different places and, moreover, was in too much demand for updating. Therefore, I began to strive for the following principles for writing documentation:
* Availability: 
  * Usage; 
  * Finding; 
  * Perception; 
* Scriptability; 
* Minimum links; 
* Automation updates. 

And now I can share with you two check-lists, each of which is performed in a different environment and has independent advantages (_but also some disadvantages, of course_).

* Check-List By Notion; 
* Check-List By Google Sheets.
